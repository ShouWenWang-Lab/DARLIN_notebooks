# Introduction
These are the jupyter notebooks for our work in [L. Li,...,S.-W. Wang, F. Camargo, Cell (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2023.09.019) 

Specifically, they are for Figure 4(cell fate bias) and Figure 5 (cell migration). 

The source data as well as all the intermediate analysis files can be downloaded from [zendo](https://zenodo.org/records/8422061)

To download all raw or processed data, please go to [GEO: GSE222486](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE222486)

We also provided a notebook `20231122_DARLIN_in_vivo_hematopoiesis.ipynb` that comes with a pre-built adata file, so that you can just focus on the downstream analysis of the lineage tracing dataset, without worrying out how to assemble the adata from scratch. The latest version of this notebook can be available from https://github.com/ShouWenWang-Lab/cospar/blob/master/docs/source/20231122_DARLIN_in_vivo_hematopoiesis.ipynb
